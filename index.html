        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">CSS is not neccessary</span><span style="background-color:yellow;"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li id="li">External stylesheets are stored inn CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element </li>
        <li>Internal - by using style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files.However,<span style="background-color:yellow ;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>  beacause this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS clas vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by Javascript.</p>
    <p>In css, section are used to target a special element or range of element on a web page. Once an elelment has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of section available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target element to which a stylee should be applied.</p>
